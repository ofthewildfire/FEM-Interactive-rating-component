# Interactive rating component

This is a Frontendmentor.io challenge | the
[interactive rating component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI)
which I created using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

I had a lot of fun, and a little bit of learning with the JS logic in regards to
having only the `checked` item within the radio button group be highlighted with
the different colour. This actually caused a bit of thinking and I loved that.

I also made some additional "good to have" changes - a button that returns you
to the main rating selection after you have already made your selection.

## Changes I Want to Make

Currently it is not in any way shape or form pixel perfect, I wanted to work on
the logic, but I also want to make it look a lot better than it currently is.

- Update design so it aligns more to the provided `jpeg`
- Read more information on how to work with heights/widths in CSS, it still
  confused me.
